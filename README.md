A smart contract design pattern that aims to increase the separation of concerns between different types of contracts, such that relationships between particular contracts can be drawn out visibly in a client.

Designed by @wandcrafting, written by me, and takes a lot of inspiration and some code from @latticexyz's MUD contracts.
